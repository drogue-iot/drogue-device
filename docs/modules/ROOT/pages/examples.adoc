= Examples

There are several examples for different chips to show how drogue device can be used. The examples
are grouped by how advanced they are, and what they demonstrate such as networking, but may overlap for examples that cover more than one area.

All example can be run using `cargo run`, which in some cases require the `probe-run` tool (`cargo
install probe-run`) to flash the program.

== Basic examples

Basic examples that only require a single board without any additional hardware.
