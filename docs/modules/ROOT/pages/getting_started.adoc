= Getting started

So you want to try Drogue Device, great! To get started, there are a few tools you need to install:

* link:https://rustup.rs/[rustup] - the Rust toolchain is needed to compile Rust code.
* link:https://crates.io/crates/probe-run[probe-run] - to flash the firmware on your device. If you already have other tools like `OpenOCD` setup, you can use that as well.

If you don't have any supported board, don't worry: you can also run drogue-device on your PC using the `std` examples.

== Getting a board with examples

Drogue Device supports many microcontroller families, but the easiest ways to get started is if you have one of the more common development kits.

== Running an example

First you need to clone the link:https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-device[github repository];

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-device.git
cd drogue-device
----

You can run an example by opening a terminal and entering the following commands:

[source, bash]
----
cd examples/std/pingpong
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release
----

If you're using any of the microcontroller examples:

[source, bash]
----
cd examples/nrf52/microbit/jukebox
DEFMT_LOG=info cargo run --release
----

IMPORTANT: The DEFMT_LOG environment variable controls the example log verbosity. If not set, you will not see anything logged to the console.
