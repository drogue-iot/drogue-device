//! Drogue Device is an open source async, no-alloc framework for embedded devices. It integrates with [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy), the embedded async project.
//!
//! See [the book](https://book.drogue.io/drogue-device/dev/index.html) for more about the architecture, how to write device drivers, and running some examples.
//!
//! # Actor System
//!
//! An _actor system_ is a framework that allows for isolating state within narrow contexts, making it easier to reason about system.
//! Within a actor system, the primary component is an _Actor_, which represents the boundary of state usage.
//! Each actor has exclusive access to its own state and only communicates with other actors through message-passing.
//!
//! # Example
