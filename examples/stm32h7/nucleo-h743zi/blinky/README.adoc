== nucleo-h743zi-blinkdance drogue-device example

This example application runs out of the box on the STM32 Nucleo H743ZI development kit.

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware

* STM32 Nucleo H743ZI development kit.
* A finger or other stick-like device to push a button.

==== Software

* To build the example, you need to have link:https://rustup.rs/[rustup].
* To flash the example on the device, you need `probe-run` installed (`cargo install probe-run`).

==== Running

To run the firmware:

....
cargo run --release
....

== Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re experiencing problems, try setting the `VID:PID` values to that of your probe (you can find that from lsusb once your board is powered).

....
cargo run --release -- --probe <VID>:<PID>
....

Once flashed, the device will reset and look no different at first. 
Upon pressing the blue user button, the LEDS will randomly blink individually until the button is released.
