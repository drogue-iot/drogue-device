== std drogue cloud example

This example demonstrates using Drogue Device sending telemetry messages to Drogue Cloud. This example runs on any target supporting the Rust standard library.

=== Prerequisites

==== Software

* To build the example, you need to have link:https://rustup.rs/[rustup].
* A service like Drogue IoT Cloud. See link:https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-cloud/[drogue-cloud] for how to run that, or use the link:https://sandbox.drogue.cloud/[sandbox] (requires TLS).

=== Configuring

To authenticate the device to the cloud service, you must store the username and password in `config/http.username.txt` and `config/http.password.txt`. For Drogue IoT Cloud, the username is stored in this form: `device_id@application`.

== Running

To run the application:

....
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release
....
