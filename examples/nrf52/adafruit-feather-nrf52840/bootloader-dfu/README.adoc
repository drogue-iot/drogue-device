= Adarfuit nRF52840 Feather DFU example

Example for the Adafruit nRF52840 Feather demonstrating bootloader and firmware update capabilities. The example assumes that the nRF softdevice is installed.

== Prerequisites

=== Hardware

* One of link:https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062[Adafruit nRF52840 Feather Express] or link:https://www.adafruit.com/product/4516[Adafruit nRF52840 Feather Sense] (requires soldering to the bottom debug pads).
* A SWD debug probe such as link:https://github.com/probe-rs/rusty-probe[Rusty Probe] or using a link:https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/[Raspberry Pi Pico] and load it with link:https://github.com/majbthrd/DapperMime[this firmware].

=== Software

Clone the link:https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy[embassy repository]. This example will assume it's available locally in the `$EMBASSY_REPO` environment variable.

Make sure you have the latest versions (`cargo install <tool>`) of these tools:

* `probe-run`
* `probe-rs-cli`
* `cargo-flash`
* `cargo-binutils`

== Usage

=== Erase current settings

```
probe-rs-cli erase --chip nRF52840_xxAA
```

=== Flash bootloader

```
cargo flash --manifest-path $EMBASSY_REPO/embassy-boot/nrf/Cargo.toml --release --features embassy-nrf/nrf52840,softdevice --chip nRF52840_xxAA
```

=== Flash nRF Softdevice

Download the softdevice version 7.3.0 link:https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/s140/download[here].

```
probe-rs-cli download path-to-softdevice.hex --format Hex --chip nRF52840_xxAA
```

=== Flash application

```
cargo flash --release --chip nRF52840_xxAA
```

When started, the device will blink it's LED at a fixed interval. You can now modify the example, and DFU it to the device with the using BLE GATT. To do that, it's convenient to use the `drgdfu` tool (`cargo install https://github.com/drogue-iot/drgdfu`).

=== Flashing a new revision using firmware update

One change you can do is to adjust the BLINK_INTERVAL constant to a different value. We can then rebuild the application and flash it using the `drgdfu` tool.

```
REVISION=myupdate cargo objcopy --release -- -O binary update.bin
```

Modifying the version in `Cargo.toml` or passing a `REVISION` environment variable will compile the firmware with a new version identifier. This identifier can be used to decide if a firmware update is needed at all by the `drgdfu`.

To use the `drgdfu` tool to update over BLE, generate a metadata file first:

```
drgdfu generate 0.2.0 update.bin > update.json
```

We can then use refer to the metadata file when running the DFU process (The MAC address can be found from discovering your device using any tool like `bluetoothsctl` and the command `scan on`):

```
drgdfu upload ble-gatt --device F8:56:35:45:1C:3C file update.json
```

Once finished, the `drgdfu` tool will wait for the device to swap the new firmware and report back the expected version. If not, it will restart the DFU process.
