== microbit-esp8266 drogue-device example

This example application runs out of the box on the BBC micro:bit v2.0.
It relies on a ESP8266 breakout module flashed with AT firmware. The micro:bit communicates with the
ESP8266 using UART.

The examples uses MQTT to publish and subscribe to an Drogue cloud sandbox.

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware

* BBC micro:bit v2.0
* ESP8266 module with AT-command firmware version 1.7.x or newer.

===== Pin configuration

Wire the ESP8266 module to the micro:bit as follows:

|Microbit |ESP8266 |Function

|P1 |GPIO15 |Flow control

|P2 |GPIO13 |Flow control

|P8 |EN |Enable

|P9 |RST |Reset

|P14 |RX |UART RX

|P15 |TX |UART TX

|V |V+ |POWER

|G |GND |GROUND

==== Software

* To build the example, you need to have link:https://rustup.rs/[rustup].
* To flash the example on the device, you need `probe-run` installed (`cargo install probe-run`).
* A TCP server (ncat) or a service like Drogue IoT Cloud. See link:https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-cloud/[drogue-cloud] for how to run that, or use the link:https://sandbox.drogue.cloud/[sandbox] (requires TLS).

=== Configuring

Credentials for your local WiFi network will come from these entries in `~/.drogue/config.toml`:

....
wifi-ssid = "..."
wifi-password = "..."
....

=== Running

The example is expected to be run against Drogue cloud sandbox. There is script `echo.sh` that will create echo from the cloud side (listening on device mqtt integration and sending same message to command endpoint).
The script is expected to be run like this:
....
./src/echo.sh your-application-in-cloud
....

To run the firmware:

....
cargo run --release
....

== Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re experiencing problems, try setting the `VID:PID` values to that of your probe (you can find that from lsusb once your board is powered).

....
cargo run --release -- --probe <VID>:<PID>
....

Once flashed, the device will reset and attempt to join the WiFi network. If successful, it will print a message to the RTT log. You can then press the 'A' button on the micro:bit board to send a test message from the device.
