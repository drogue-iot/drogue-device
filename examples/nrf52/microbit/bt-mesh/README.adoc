= Microbit Bluetooth Mesh example

This example application runs out of the box on the BBC micro:bit. It starts as a Bluetooth Mesh
sensor server(as defined by specification) reporting from the on board temperature sensor.

The example assumes that the nRF softdevice is installed.

== Prerequisites

=== Hardware

* BBC Micro:bit v2

=== Software

Make sure you have the latest versions (`cargo install <tool>`) of these tools:

* link:https://rustup.rs/[rustup] - To compile the example with the correct toolchain.
* link:https://crates.io/crates/probe-rs-cli[probe-rs-cli] - To flash the BLE protocol stack from Nordic Semiconductor.
* link:https://crates.io/crates/probe-run[probe-run] - To run the example.
* `cargo-flash`
* `cargo-binutils`

== Usage

=== Erase current settings

```
probe-rs-cli erase --chip nRF52833_xxAA
```

=== Flash nRF Softdevice

Download the softdevice version 7.3.0 link:https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/s140/download[here].

```
probe-rs-cli download s140_nrf52_7.3.0_softdevice.hex --chip nRF52833_xxAA --format Hex
```

=== Flash application

```
cargo flash --release --chip nRF52833_xxAA
```

When started, the device will blink an 'X' every 5 seconds.

When started, the device will blink a check mark every 5 seconds.
