== microbit-rak811 drogue-device example

This example application runs out of the box on the BBC micro:bit v2.0.
It relies on a RAK811 breakout module flashed with AT firmware. The micro:bit communicates with the
RAK811 using UART.

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware

* BBC micro:bit v2.0
* RAK811 module with AT-command firmware version 2.x (3.x not yet supported by driver)

==== Software

To build and flash the example, you need to have
link:https://rustup.rs/[rustup]. In practice
you can use whatever tool you want to flash the device, but this guide
will assume that `probe-run` is used (`cargo install probe-run`).

=== Configuring

To use this example, you need to create the files `config/dev_eui.txt`, `config/app_eui.txt`, and
`config/app_key.txt` to configure the device EUI, application EUI, and application key for OTAA
configuration of your device.

=== Building

Make sure you have the correct target architecture supported in rust:

....
rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
....

To build the firmware:

....
cargo build --release
....

=== Flashing

Flashing the firmware uses `probe-run` which auto-detects the probe connected to your device. 
The following command will build and flash the firmware and open the
debugger console so you can see the console debug output.

....
cargo run --release
....

If youâ€™re experiencing problems, try setting the `VID:PID` values to
that of your probe (you can find that from lsusb once your board is
powered).

....
cargo run --release -- --probe <VID>:<PID>
....

=== Usage

Once the device is flashed, it will connect to the local LoRaWAN network. Once the network is joined, you can press the 'A' button on the micro:bit to send a test message `ping`.
