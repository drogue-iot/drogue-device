== lora-discovery example

This example application runs out of the box on the STM32 LoRa Discovery Kit (B-L072Z-LRWAN1).

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware

* link:https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l072z-lrwan1.html[STM32 LoRa Discovery Kit]

==== Software

To build and flash the example, you need to have
https://rustup.rs/[rustup]. In practice
you can use whatever tool you want to flash the device, but this guide
will assume that `probe-run` is used (`cargo install probe-run`).

=== Configuring

To use this example, you need to create the files `config/dev_eui.txt`, `config/app_eui.txt`, and
`config/app_key.txt` to configure the device EUI, application EUI, and application key for OTAA
configuration of your device.

=== Building

To build the firmware:

....
cargo build --release
....

=== Flashing

Flashing the firmware uses `probe-run` which auto-detects the probe connected to your device. 
The following command will build and flash the firmware and open the
debugger console so you can see the console debug output.

....
cargo run --release
....

If youâ€™re experiencing problems, try setting the `VID:PID` values to
that of your probe (you can find that from lsusb once your board is
powered).

....
cargo run --release -- --probe <VID>:<PID>
....


=== Usage

Once the device is flashed, it will connect to the local LoRaWAN network. Once the network is joined, you can press
the blue button on the development kit to send a test message `ping:<num-clicks>`, where `num-clicks` is the number
of times you pressed the button since resetting the board.

==== LEDs

The board features 4 user controllable LEDs. The program will use 3 of them to show the internal status:

Red:: Will light up when starting and turn off once it joined the LoRa network.
Green:: Turns on while sending the uplink message.
Blue:: Can be controlled through the downlink message: `led:on` or `led:off`.
