== RaspBerry Pi Pico blinky example 

This example application runs out of the box on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware

* link:https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/[RaspBerry Pi Pico]

==== Software

* link:https://rustup.rs/[rustup] to build the code
* link:https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk[Pico SDK] to convert binary from ELF to UF2 format. Follow the instructions there to build the SDK.

=== Building

To build the firmware:

....
cargo build --release
....

=== Flashing

Flashing the firmware uses the built-in bootloader on the pico (At present, probe-run does not support the pico).

First, power up the pico while holding the `BOOTSEL` button. This should put turn the pico into a USB mass storage device that will be attached to your computer.

To convert the firmware to the format expected by the SDK, run the elf2uf2 tool:

....
$PICO_SDK_PATH/build/elf2uf2/elf2uf2 target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/blinky blinky.uf2
....

To flash the device, copy the `blinky.uf2` to the attached mass storage device (path may vary depending on your OS):

....
cp blinky.uf2 /run/media/myuser/RPI-RP2
....
