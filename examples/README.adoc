= drogue-device examples

The examples are grouped by chip family, then board, then variant. I.e.

For instance, the example in `nrf52/microbit/esp8266` is for the `nRF52` chip family, using the `microbit` board,
with a variant that uses a `esp8266` WiFi module.

All example can be run using `cargo run`, which in some cases require the `probe-run` tool (`cargo
install probe-run`) to flash the program.

=== Configuration

Any examples requiring user credentials, e.g. WiFi, HTTP, OTAA, will
expect them in the top-level keys of `~/.drogue/config.toml`.

Credentials for your local WiFi network:
....
wifi-ssid = "..."
wifi-password = "..."
....

HTTP authentication:
....
http-username = "..."
http-password = "..."
....

_Over The Air Authentication_ (OTAA) credentials:
....
"dev-eui" = "..."
"app-eui" = "..."
"app-key" = "..."
....

These values will be read during compilation and stored in the executable. For any missing keys, empty strings will be used.
